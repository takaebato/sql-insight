//! The bind-time **scope**: what's visible at a point in the bind, as scratch
//! threaded bottom-up (`bind_* -> (LogicalPlan, Scope)`) and never stored on
//! the tree.
//!
//! A [`Scope`] groups three kinds of in-scope state:
//! - `relations` — the FROM relations a column reference resolves its owner
//!   against.
//! - `query_outputs` — this (sub)query's SELECT-list output columns, visible by
//!   name to its own GROUP BY / HAVING / ORDER BY and harvested by a parent as a
//!   derived table / CTE's exposed columns.
//! - `merge_columns` — `JOIN … USING (col)` names that fan in to every owning
//!   side.
//!
//! Enclosing scopes (correlation) and the CTE registry are *not* here — they
//! live on the [`Binder`](super::Binder) (`outer` / `ctes`) and are extended by
//! spawning child binders, because an inner subquery reaches enclosing
//! *relations* (and CTE declarations), not their outputs or merge columns.
